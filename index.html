                    <h1>First International Workshop on DevOps</h1>

DevOps bridges the divide between development and operations. It is a new driver for business agility and IT alignment. Business is demanding ever shortening release cycles, yet the complexity of production deployment ever increases. DevOps aims to address these conflicting constraints, thereby enabling Continuous Delivery. DevOps includes tools for automating the release cycle, tools for bringing the production environment to development and tighter coordination between developers, operations staff and the business.

<p>
The traditional route for a software product, from development to operations is a long road. Unit tests are conducted on the developer's workstation, regression tests are then conducted as part of the build process, quality assurance then validates the new features. After numerous iterations, as well as stress and performance testing, the product is released to customers. Each customer's IT operations team will then subject the product to their own rigorous testing process before deploying it in their production environment. As the product progresses through each stage of the release lifecycle, it is subjected to a different configuration and environment. This not only slows the transition from one stage to the next but also obscures problems which exist in the customer's environment from development. "It works for us" is the all too common response customers hear from software vendors. DevOps includes tools and processes to not only compress the software release cycle, thereby enabling Continuous Delivery, but also to enhance quality by bringing the conditions of the customer's environment into the development process.

<p>
The First International Workshop on DevOps will be held in conjunction with 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on <b><a href="http://ase2015.unl.edu/">Automated Software Engineering</a></b> Conference (ASE2015).

<p>
The principal aim of this workshop is to identify a <b>roadmap</b> of activities that will advance the state-of-the-art of in DevOps. To this end the workshop will bring together software engineering researchers and development and operations staff from the software industry to share the latest knowledge and tools to address the DevOps problem.

<p>
A <b>communique</b> of the agreed DevOps roadmap will be released at the end of the workshop and be published in the proceedings. All workshop participants will be included as authors on the communique.

                    <h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>
The First International Workshop on DevOps seeks <b>short papers</b> and <b>position statements</b> that highlight industrial challenges, breakthroughs, case studies, as well as corresponding research challenges. We also invite <b>tool demonstrations</b> (including commercial and research DevOps tools.) In particular, we seek submissions with high take-away value to help practitioners improve their own DevOps processes, techniques, and results. Also valuable are position statements that help academics identify important new areas of research.

<p>
Suggested topics include but are not limited to:

<table border=0 class="topics">
<tr>
<td>Continuous Delivery</td>
<td>DevOps Processes</td>
<td>Containerization</td>
<td>Structures &amp; Standards</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Virtualization</td>
<td>Release Automation</td>
<td>Orchestration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration Management</td>
<td>DevOps Measurement</td>
<td>Culture</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>

<p>
Submissions for this workshop should provide clear take-away value by describing the context of a problem of practical importance; discussing why the solution of the problem is innovative, effective, or efficient; providing a concise explanation of the approach, techniques, and methodologies employed; and explaining the best practices that emerged, tools developed, and/or software processes involved. Furthermore, submissions should describe broader applicability; overall assessment of benefits, risks and mitigations, and other lessons learned. 

<p>
Submissions should be in <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE format</a>, may be up to 8 pages in length and will appear in the workshop proceedings, which will be published in the IEEE Digital Library.
